This repository is for better-using of hvsrpy, especially when new student want to get fast familar with hvsrpy and their own dataset.
=======================================

1. First thing, we should install 'hvsrpy', which you could figure out in the link (https://github.com/jpvantassel/hvsrpy). You could follow this link and install 'hvsrpy' and I will not cover more details here.

If you don't install jupyter notebook yet, you may also need to install it before your calculation. You could refer to this link (https://blog.csdn.net/m0_68678046/article/details/129703799).

And now you could get yourself familiar with hvsrpy by processing their examples.

2. Second step, we should prepare with the raw data.
